1. Fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, chlorides, free sulfur dioxide, and total sulfur dioxide all seem to have outliers, a few points that are significantly removed from the rest of the data. 
2. The accuracy achieved by ZeroR is 62.381%, which is the percentage of wines classified as 'bad' in the training set. This makes sense, as ZeroR simply chooses the majority class in all cases. This can be a helpful baseline as it can show whether other classifiers are better or worse than just guessing. If another classifier is significantly better than ZeroR, then we can assume that it has accurately found some correlation between the attributes and classification. 
3. The most informative single feature for this task is alcohol content. The higher the alcohol content, the more likely the wine quality is to be good. 
4. 95.873% -> 85.979$. 10-fold cross-validation involves splitting the training set into 10 equally sized subsets and using 1 as test data and the other 9 as training data. The main reason the percentage differs is that when measuring accuracy with the training set, the decision tree is specifically tailored to perform well with the training set. This can give an artificially high accuracy. By splitting the data into a training set and a test set, we are more closely approximating the performance of the decision tree on a set that it was not specifically tailored for. This makes 10-fold cross-validation very important, as it can give us a much better idea of how our decision tree performs in general.
